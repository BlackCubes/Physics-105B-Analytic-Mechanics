/* MATHEMATICA HW 2 */

What's up everyone!

This here was my second homework which I did for my Analytic Mechanics class (PHYS 105B). We explored by doing some of the book problems containing rotational inertia and coupled-oscillation.

It was coded using Mathematica. There is a Mathematica file '.nb' which I did, and a PDF file 'hw02_105B' is the description of the homework assigment given by the instructor for the students to perform.
