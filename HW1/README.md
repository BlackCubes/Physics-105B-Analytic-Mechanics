# MATHEMATICA HW 1

What's up everyone!

This here was my first assignment which I did for my Analytic Mechanics class (PHYS 105B). We explored by finding the velocity of each particle in the center-of-mass frame, a couple of center-of-mass calculations, deriving the Rutherford differential scattering cross-section from first principles, and some book problems

It was coded using Mathematica. There is a Mathematica file '.nb' which I did, and a PDF file 'hw01_105B' is the description of the homework assigment given by the instructor for the students to perform.
