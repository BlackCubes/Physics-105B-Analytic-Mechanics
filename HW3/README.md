# MATHEMATICA HW 3

What's up everyone!

This here was my third homework which I did for my Analytic Mechanics class (PHYS 105B). We explored by settting up wave equations, plotting, and animating; beat phenomenon by plotting and animating; the shape of the amplitude distribution; plotting the Gaussian Probability function and a particular function as well as plotting their Fourier transforms; and using Fourier transformation on beats, a particular function, and a "CW" signal to obtain the spectral decompositions.

It was coded using Mathematica. There is a Mathematica file '.nb' which I did, and a PDF file 'hw03_105B' is the description of the homework assigment given by the instructor for the students to perform.
