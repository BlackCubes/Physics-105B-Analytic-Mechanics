# Physics-105B-Analytic-Mechanics

What's up everyone! This is a physics course which is title "PHYSICS 105B: Analytic Mechanics" held at UCLA which I took as an undergraduate.

The course description is such that it involves Relativity with four vectors, noninertial reference frames, dynamics of rigid bodies, coupled oscillators, normal modes of oscillation, vibrating strings, and wave propagation. It also involves Mathematica as extra homework assignments as well as a take home mathematica midterm.

Please do look through some of the folders which have the assignment homeworks in PDF given from the teacher to complete, my assigments in Mathematica file, and my take home mathematica midterm title "Take-Home-Midterm."

Any questions or comments are highly appreciated! Thanks, and enjoy looking through my files!
