/* MATHEMATICA HW 5 */

What's up everyone!

This here was my fifth and last homework which I did for my Analytic Mechanics class (PHYS 105B). We explored Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.

It was coded using Mathematica. There is a Mathematica file '.nb' which I did, and a PDF file 'mathematicahw05_105B' is the description of the homework assigment given by the instructor for the students to perform.
